# weather-dashboard

## Description
This project was assigned to me through MSU Coding Bootcamp, and was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also added bootstrap and icon CDNs.

 I was given the task of creating a Weather Dashboard, where when a user searches for a city then they are presented with current and future conditions for that city. 


When a city is searched, then that city is added to the search history. The city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index are shown. 

The UV Index will display a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. 

A 5 day forecast for that city will also be presented, displaying the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity as well. 

And lastly, when a city is clicked on in the search history, then the user is again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
